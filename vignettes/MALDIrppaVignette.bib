abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein profiling with high-throughput sample preparation and MALDI-TOF MS analysis is a new potential tool for diagnosis of human diseases. However, analytical reproducibility is a significant challenge in MALDI protein profiling. This minireview summarizes studies of reproducibility of MALDI protein profiling and current approaches to improve its analytical performance.

METHODS: The PubMed database was searched using combinations of the following search terms: MALDI, SELDI, reproducibility, variation, precision, peak intensity, quantification, peptide, biomarkers, and proteomics. Acceptance criteria were detailed reports on the reproducibility with MALDI protein profiling and studies describing efforts to improve the analytical performance with this technology.

RESULTS: The reported intraexperiment CVs of the peak intensity vary highly between individual protein peaks, with the reported mean CV of the peak intensity varying among studies from 4\% to 26\%. There is additional interexperiment variation in peak intensity. Current approaches to improve the analytical performance of MALDI protein profiling include automated sample processing, extensive prefractionation strategies, immunocapture, prestructured target surfaces, standardized matrix (co)crystallization, improved MALDI-TOF MS instrument components, internal standard peptides, quality-control samples, replicate measurements, and algorithms for normalization and peak detection.

CONCLUSIONS: Further evaluation and optimization of MALDI-TOF MS is recommended before use in routine analysis.},

The commercial application of these technologies to pathogen identification has only begun in the last five years, and already new potentially life-saving applications of these technologies are rapidly identifying organisms that in the past have proven notoriously difficult to identify. In this review, we will provide a brief historical perspective on how these developments arose, describe why they are being successfully applied now and provide an overview of current approaches.

abstract = {The proteome, defined as an organism's proteins and their actions, is a highly complex end-effector of molecular and cellular events. Differing amounts of proteins in a sample can be indicators of an individual's health status; thus, it is valuable to identify key proteins that serve as 'biomarkers' for diseases. Since the proteome cannot be simply inferred from the genome due to pre- and posttranslational modifications, a direct approach toward mapping the proteome must be taken. The difficulty in evaluating a large number of individual proteins has been eased with the development of high-throughput methods based on mass spectrometry (MS) of peptide or protein mixtures, bypassing the time-consuming, laborious process of protein purification. However, proteomic profiling by MS requires extensive computational analysis. This article describes key issues and recent advances in computational analysis of mass spectra for biomarker identification.},

@article{Sandrin2013,
abstract = {Since the advent of the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF MS) as a tool for microbial characterization, efforts to increase the taxonomic resolution of the approach have been made. The rapidity and efficacy of the approach have suggested applications in counter-bioterrorism, prevention of food contamination, and monitoring the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Strain-level resolution has been reported with diverse bacteria, using library-based and bioinformatics-enabled approaches. Three types of characterization at the strain level have been reported: strain categorization, strain differentiation, and strain identification. Efforts to enhance the library-based approach have involved sample pre-treatment and data reduction strategies. Bioinformatics approaches have leveraged the ever-increasing amount of publicly available genomic and proteomic data to attain strain-level characterization. Bioinformatics-enabled strategies have facilitated strain characterization via intact biomarker identification, bottom-up, and top-down approaches. Rigorous quantitative and advanced statistical analyses have fostered success at the strain level with both approaches. Library-based approaches can be limited by effects of sample preparation and culture conditions on reproducibility, whereas bioinformatics-enabled approaches are typically limited to bacteria, for which genetic and/or proteomic data are available. Biological molecules other than proteins produced in strain-specific manners, including lipids and lipopeptides, might represent other avenues by which strain-level resolution might be attained. Immunological and lectin-based chemistries have shown promise to enhance sensitivity and specificity. Whereas the limits of the taxonomic resolution of MALDI TOF MS profiling of bacteria appears bacterium-specific, recent data suggest that these limits might not yet have been reached.},

abstract = {At present, there is much variability between MALDI-TOF MS methodology for the characterization of bacteria through differences in e.g., sample preparation methods, matrix solutions, organic solvents, acquisition methods and data analysis methods. After evaluation of the existing methods, a standard protocol was developed to generate MALDI-TOF mass spectra obtained from a collection of reference strains belonging to the genera Leuconostoc, Fructobacillus and Lactococcus. Bacterial cells were harvested after 24h of growth at 28°C on the media MRS or TSA. Mass spectra were generated, using the CHCA matrix combined with a 50:48:2 acetonitrile:water:trifluoroacetic acid matrix solution, and analyzed by the cell smear method and the cell extract method. After a data preprocessing step, the resulting high quality data set was used for PCA, distance calculation and multi-dimensional scaling. Using these analyses, species-specific information in the MALDI-TOF mass spectra could be demonstrated. As a next step, the spectra, as well as the binary character set derived from these spectra, were successfully used for species identification within the genera Leuconostoc, Fructobacillus, and Lactococcus. Using MALDI-TOF MS identification libraries for Leuconostoc and Fructobacillus strains, 84\% of the MALDI-TOF mass spectra were correctly identified at the species level. Similarly, the same analysis strategy within the genus Lactococcus resulted in 94\% correct identifications, taking species and subspecies levels into consideration. Finally, two machine learning techniques were evaluated as alternative species identification tools. The two techniques, support vector machines and random forests, resulted in accuracies between 94\% and 98\% for the identification of Leuconostoc and Fructobacillus species, respectively.},

abstract = {The techniques of enzymatic and chemical peptide ladder sequencing, coupled with ultraviolet - matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization - mass spectrometry (UV-MALDI-MS) have been improving continuously in the last five years and have now become important tools for primary structure identification. In this work, signal suppression effects, appearing in UV-MALDI-MS (excitation 337 nm) of ladder peptides, were investigated using the 17-amino acid peptide dynorphin A. We show, with examples of simple "two-peptide" systems and more complex "multi-peptide" systems, that suppression effects do in fact exist. The magnitude of the observed suppression is strongly dependent upon both the nature and the amount of the suppressing peptide. Suppression behavior of individual ladder peptides was investigated on equimolar mixtures of ten ladder peptides. Significant signal suppression was recorded for all ladder peptides, with some of them being approximately 170 times lower in signal intensity than the pure, i.e., unsuppressed peptide at the same concentration. For the investigated system--dynorphin A, 4-hydroxy-alpha-cyanocinnamic acid (4-HCCA) matrix, UV excitation--a correlation between the extent of suppression and an intractable combination of peptide hydrophobicity and the presence of several basic amino acids can be seen.},

abstract = {The minimum covariance determinant (MCD) method of Rousseeuw is a highly robust estimator of multivariate location and scatter. Its objective is to find h observations (out of n) whose covariance matrix has the lowest determinant. Until now, applications of the MCD were hampered by the computation time of existing algorithms, which were limited to a few hundred objects in a few dimensions. We discuss two important applications of larger size, one about a production process at Philips with n = 677 objects and p = 9 variables, and a dataset from astronomy with n = 137,256 objects and p = 27 variables. To deal with such problems we have developed a new algorithm for the MCD, called FAST-MCD. The basic ideas are an inequality involving order statistics and determinants, and techniques which we call "selective iteration" and "nested extensions." For small datasets, FAST-MCD typically finds the exact MCD, whereas for larger datasets it gives more accurate results than existing algorithms and is faster by orders of magnitude. Moreover, FAST-MCD is able to detect an exact fit-that is, a hyperplane containing h or more observations. The new algorithm makes the MCD method available as a routine tool for analyzing multivariate data. We also propose the distance-distance plot (D-D plot), which displays MCD-based robust distances versus Mahalanobis distances, and illustrate it with some examples.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mass spectrometry (MS) data are often generated from various biological or chemical experiments and there may exist outlying observations, which are extreme due to technical reasons. The determination of outlying observations is important in the analysis of replicated MS data because elaborate pre-processing is essential for successful analysis with reliable results and manual outlier detection as one of pre-processing steps is time-consuming. The heterogeneity of variability and low replication are often obstacles to successful analysis, including outlier detection. Existing approaches, which assume constant variability, can generate many false positives (outliers) and/or false negatives (non-outliers). Thus, a more powerful and accurate approach is needed to account for the heterogeneity of variability and low replication.

FINDINGS: We proposed an outlier detection algorithm using projection and quantile regression in MS data from multiple experiments. The performance of the algorithm and program was demonstrated by using both simulated and real-life data. The projection approach with linear, nonlinear, or nonparametric quantile regression was appropriate in heterogeneous high-throughput data with low replication.

CONCLUSION: Various quantile regression approaches combined with projection were proposed for detecting outliers. The choice among linear, nonlinear, and nonparametric regressions is dependent on the degree of heterogeneity of the data. The proposed approach was illustrated with MS data with two or more replicates.},

abstract = {An Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain isolated from a patient with hemorrhagic colitis was found to exhibit two slightly different colony morphology types on differential medium. Each morphological type, designated TT12A and TT12B, was isolated, and serological testing using various assays confirmed that both strains carried the O157 and the H7 antigens. Biochemical testing showed that the strains had identical profiles on AP120E analysis and, like typical O157:H7 strains, did not ferment sorbitol or exhibit beta-glucuronidase activity. Analysis with a multiplex PCR assay showed that TT12B did not carry the gene for either Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) or Stx2, whereas these genes were present in TT12A and the toxins were produced. Apart from that, both strains carried the +93 gusA mutation, the cluster I ehxA gene for enterohemolysin, and the eae gene for gamma-intimin, which are all characteristics of the O157:H7 serotype. Phenotypic assays confirmed that both strains exhibited enterohemolysin activity and the attachment and effacing lesion on HeLa cells. Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis analysis showed that the strains are closely related genetically and belong in the same clonal group. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing of XbaI-digested genomic DNA revealed that the two strains differed by two bands but shared 90\% similarity and clustered in the same clade. All other non-Stx-producing O157:H7 strains examined clustered in a major clade that was distinct from that of Stx-producing O157:H7 strains. The findings that TT12B was identical to TT12A, except for Stx production, and its PFGE profile is also more closely related to that of Stx-producing O157:H7 strains suggest that TT12B was derived from TT12A by the loss of both stx genes.},

Close to 75,000 cases of O157:H7 infection are now estimated to occur annually in the United States. The severity of disease, the lack of effective treatment and the potential for large-scale outbreaks from contaminated food supplies have propelled intensive research on the pathogenesis and detection of E. coli O157:H7 (ref. 4). Here we have sequenced the genome of E. coli O157:H7 to identify candidate genes responsible for pathogenesis, to develop better methods of strain detection and to advance our understanding of the evolution of E. coli, through comparison with the genome of the non-pathogenic laboratory strain E. coli K-12 (ref. 5).

In the EHEC strains, as well as in other VT-producing E. coli strains, the toxins are encoded by lysogenic bacteriophages. The EHEC O157:H7 strain RIMD 0509952 did not produce plaque-forming phage particles upon inducing treatments. We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of a prophage, VT2-Sakai, carrying the stx2A and stx2B genes on the chromosome, and presumed the putative functions of the encoded proteins and the cis-acting DNA elements based on sequence homology data. To our surprise, the sequences in the regions of VT2-Sakai corresponding to the early gene regulators and replication proteins, and the DNA sequences recognized by the regulators share very limited homology to those of the VT2-encoding 933W phage carried by the EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 reported by Plunkett et al. (J. Bacteriol., p1767-1778, 181, 1999), although the sequences corresponding to the structural components are almost identical. These data suggest that these two phages were derived from a common ancestral phage and that either or both of them underwent multiple genetic rearrangements. An IS629 insertion was found downstream of the stx2B gene and upstream of the lysis gene S, and this might be responsible for the absence of plaque-forming activity in the lysate obtained after inducing treatments.},

It shows information about the location, spread, skewness as well as the tails of the data. However, when the data are skewed, usually many points exceed the whiskers and are often erroneously declared as outliers. An adjustment of the boxplot is presented that includes a robust measure of skewness in the determination of the whiskers. This results in a more accurate representation of the data and of possible outliers. Consequently, this adjusted boxplot can also be used as a fast and automatic outlier detection tool without making any parametric assumption about the distribution of the bulk of the data.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mass spectrometry is actively being used to discover disease-related proteomic patterns in complex mixtures of proteins derived from tissue samples or from easily obtained biological fluids. The potential importance of these clinical applications has made the development of better methods for processing and analyzing the data an active area of research. It is, however, difficult to determine which methods are better without knowing the true biochemical composition of the samples used in the experiments.

METHODS: We developed a mathematical model based on the physics of a simple MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer with time-lag focusing. Using this model, we implemented a statistical simulation of mass spectra. We used the simulation to explore some of the basicoperating characteristics of MALDI or SELDI instruments.

RESULTS: The simulation reproduced several characteristics of actual instruments. We found that the relative mass error is affected by the time discretization of the detector (about 0.01\%) and the spread of initial velocities (about 0.1\%). The accuracy of calibration based on external standards decays rapidly outside the range spanned by the calibrants. Natural isotope distributions play a major role inbroadening peaks associated with individual proteins. The area of a peak is a more accurate measure of its size than the height.

CONCLUSIONS: The model described here is capable of simulating realistic mass spectra. The simulation should become a useful tool forgenerating spectra where the true inputs are known, allowing researchers to evaluate the performance of new methods for processing and analyzing mass spectra.

abstract = {In November 1986, a statewide outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections in Washington State was identified after a physician in an eastern Washington community hospitalized three patients with hemorrhagic colitis which progressed to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Epidemiologic investigation identified 37 cases in this community and linked the illnesses to a local restaurant which had served ground beef that was the suspected initial vehicle of transmission. The plasmid profile and toxin production pattern (Shiga-like toxin II alone) of the outbreak strain provided a unique strain marker. E. coli O157:H7 infections caused by this strain were simultaneously seen in other parts of the state among nursing home residents and in patients with the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and an increase in sporadic cases of hemorrhagic colitis was noted at a Seattle health maintenance organization. It is suspected that a contaminated product, probably ground beef distributed statewide, was the common source. Tracing of this meat led to farms where rectal swabs from six (1\%) of 539 cattle tested yielded E. coli O157:H7, although the plasmids and toxin production patterns of these isolates differed from the human outbreak strain. Introduction of a single strain of E. coli O157:H7 has the potential to cause widespread concurrent outbreaks. Such outbreaks are likely to escape recognition until heightened screening and surveillance for E. coli O157:H7 is established.},

abstract = {For the analysis of the spectra of complex biofluids, preprocessing methods play a crucial role in rendering the subsequent data analyses more robust and accurate. Normalization is a preprocessing method, which accounts for different dilutions of samples by scaling the spectra to the same virtual overall concentration. In the field of 1H NMR metabonomics integral normalization, which scales spectra to the same total integral, is the de facto standard. In this work, it is shown that integral normalization is a suboptimal method for normalizing spectra from metabonomic studies. Especially strong metabonomic changes, evident as massive amounts of single metabolites in samples, significantly hamper the integral normalization resulting in incorrectly scaled spectra. The probabilistic quotient normalization is introduced in this work. This method is based on the calculation of a most probable dilution factor by looking at the distribution of the quotients of the amplitudes of a test spectrum by those of a reference spectrum. Simulated spectra, spectra of urine samples from a metabonomic study with cyclosporin-A as the active compound, and spectra of more than 4000 samples of control animals demonstrate that the probabilistic quotient normalization is by far more robust and more accurate than the widespread integral normalization and vector length normalization.},

abstract = {Quantitative high-throughput mass spectrometry has become an established tool to measure relative gene expression proteome-wide. The output of such an experiment usually consists of a list of expression ratios (fold changes) for several thousand proteins between two conditions. However, we observed that individual peptide fold changes may show a significantly different behavior than other peptides from the same protein and that these differences cannot be explained by imprecise measurements. Such outlier peptides can be the consequence of several technical (misidentifications, misquantifications) or biological (post-translational modifications, differential regulation of isoforms) reasons. We developed a method to detect outlier peptides in mass spectrometry data which is able to delineate imprecise measurements from real outlier peptides with high accuracy when the true difference is as small as 1.4 fold. We applied our method to experimental data and investigated the different technical and biological effects that result in outlier peptides. Our method will assist future research to reduce technical bias and can help to identify genes with differentially regulated protein isoforms in high throughput mass spectrometry data.},
